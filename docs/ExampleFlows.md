**1. Cal Poly Student Example Flow**

Steve is a 3rd year Cal Poly physics major in desperate need of getting out of the lab. He heard from his friend Dave about this new app Peak Peeps that allows them to connect and see each other's favorite outdoor routes. When he first downloads the app, he calls /socials/add on the username Biker_Dave, his friend Dave’s account. 

While Steve waits for Dave to accept his request, he already knows of his favorite secret biking route that he wants to add to the site, especially to share with Dave and his other biker friends. He calls /routes/add and passes in the parameters: name, location, coordinates, length_in_miles, difficulty, and activities. 

The next day, Steve is bored and wants to go for a hike that he’s never tried before. Since he is still lacking many friends on the app, he decides to check out the popular routes with /routes/popular and decides to only filter by activities as he’s looking for a hike. He finds one he likes and heads out for the adventure of the day. Afterwards, he marks that he logged this hike, causing the app to call /peepcoins/add to add a balance to his account. 

A couple months later, Steve’s activity on the app has skyrocketed. Since he’s attending school in the area, he’s able to log many hours accomplishing trails around the area. As a result, his stock of Peep Coins has also skyrocketed, enough to purchase a coupon. Conveniently, there is currently a coupon to Old SLO BBQ co available, his favorite BBQ restaurant. He quickly calls /peepcoins/purchase/coupon to trade his Peep Coins in for the coupon, and he’s set for dinner tonight.
