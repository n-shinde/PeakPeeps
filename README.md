# Project Proposal 
Want to find the best routes around SLO that all your friends are visiting? With our app, discover the best outdoor routes for cycling, hiking, and more! Review and add new routes, and give your community suggestions on where to go based on your activity. Popular routes that get posted frequently with high ratings are highlighted on the front page, so you won’t miss out on the best routes in your area. If you’d like a more personalized experience, make sure to connect with your friends and check out routes that they’ve done and recommend. Our database can filter by activity type, rating, and proximity to popular landmarks in the greater SLO area.
