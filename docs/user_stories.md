**Assignment Reqs**:
Each group must come up with a list of 12 user stories for their proposed project. Additionally, you must document at least 12 possible exceptions/error scenarios you need to handle. 

**User Stories**:

Cal Poly Student: As a college student, I want ways to find new outdoor routes that are popular with other students my age and find hidden gems around the area that my friends post about.

Normal Goer: As a casual hiker, I want to find easily accessible routes near me so that I can enjoy a quick walk or run when I get some free time. 

Visitor: As a visitor to town, I want to find the most popular sites and adventures so that I can see the best this town has to offer in my short time here.

Local Triathlon Team: As a triathlon team, we are always looking for a change of scenery and new routes to push our limits in our training.

GateKeeper: As someone who likes to keep trails for myself, yet documenting my experience for my close friends I am looking for an app that gives me the power to limit the popularity of a certain site while maintaining it to my close friends.

Student Athletes: As a college athlete, I’m always looking for ways to work out that aren’t necessarily as crowded as the gym, so I look for routes that give me space to go for runs and bike rides without disturbing others. 

Senior Citizen: I’m a senior citizen who has recently gone through physical therapy, and I’d like to explore places that are easy to navigate and have amenities like restrooms, water, and guided paths. 

Families: As a family of four raising our children in the suburbs, we want to choose safe hiking routes that our friends and other families recommend! 

Person who needs friends:  
I just moved to San Luis Obispo and I’m looking for friends to do outdoor activities with, so I’d like to join groups, add friends, and share my activity publicly to stay connected.

Social media influencer: 
As a fitness influencer on Instagram, my followers are always looking for the best outdoor spots to explore, so I want to be able to upload photos for others to see, write reviews, and create a fanbase or community with just my followers. 

Surf Shop: With so many surf shops available to rent from along the Central Coast, we want to stand out as a local business by offering free gear and discounted rentals to PeakPeeps users who complete athletic challenges on the app. 

Old SLO BBQ Co: As owners of a local barbeque shop with successful competitors like Firestone Grill and Nobu, we want to attract more customers and gain publicity by offering deals on sandwiches based on how many peep coins are earned by users through PeakPeeps. 


**Exceptions**:

If a user wants to map something that’s not in the region of our app, the app will return an error explaining that their trail falls outside of the area supported by our platform. 

A previously logged trail is now blocked due to construction, road closures, or other issues. Users can make notes on trails so that others know about unexpected closures. 

When a user has a spelling error when searching up a route or other user's name, suggestions with similar spelling will be given.

When a user searches up a route that doesn’t exist (and no alternative spelling suggestions can be given), they get asked if they would like to add the route themselves.

If a user applies too many filters and no routes match those filters, the app returns an error message “No Routes Found - Try Updating Filters”. 

The user tries to redeem too many PeepCoins (Sweat coins), it will return a message telling them to earn more coins! :)

If a user is reported by multiple users, that user will be banned from the app. 

If a user is banned, they can submit an appeal to revoke that ban. 

When a user tries to redeem a coupon that expired, the app deposits the coins spent on the coupon back into their account.

A user tries to add someone to their network that is banned. The app returns a blank screen saying “User not found”.

If a trail has an average rating of less than 2 stars with more than 10 reviews, then the trail will be removed from the app.

If a user tries to access a trail in their “Favorites” list that was removed from the app, the app returns a message saying “Route No Longer Active”.
